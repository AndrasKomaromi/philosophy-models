# philosophy-models
I upload on this git different ontological models in the domain of philosophy related to my blog: https://philosophy-models.blog/
The models are created according to the following standards:
1/ OWL (Web Ontology Language), a W3C standard: https://www.w3.org/OWL/
2/ BFO (Basic Formal Ontology), developed by Barry Smith and Pierre Grenon: https://basic-formal-ontology.org/
3/ gUFO (A Lightweight Implementation of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)), developed by Jo√£o Paulo A. Almeida, Ricardo A. Falbo, 
Giancarlo Guizzardi, Tiago P. Sales: https://nemo-ufes.github.io/gufo/
